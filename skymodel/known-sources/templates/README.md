Sources modelled by dedicated templates

The file templates.dat contains the list of sources modelled using templates. Each source must be identified trhough gammacat id
The source names in the file templates dat are identical to the templated file names.

The formalism for the template of a given source is:

[name].xml --> spectral model
[name]_map.fits --> diffuse map describing the morphology (normalization not required)

for sources with multiple diffuse maps, the adopted formalism is:
[name]_src[#]_map.fits
